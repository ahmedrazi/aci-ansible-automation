why we use localhost ansible_connection=local in the inventory file for ACI automation:
Why localhost?
When working with Cisco ACI, we're not actually SSH-ing into any devices
We're making API calls to the APIC controller
The automation runs on your local machine, which makes the API calls
The playbook executes locally and communicates with APIC via its REST API


Why ansible_connection=local?
ansible_connection=local tells Ansible not to try to make an SSH connection
Instead, it executes the tasks directly on your machine
This is needed because:

ACI modules use REST API calls, not SSH
The cisco.aci collection is designed to run locally and make API calls
We don't need to establish a traditional network connection to the device

Here's a visualization:
CopyWithout local connection (traditional networking):
Ansible → SSH → Network Device

With local connection (ACI):
Ansible → Local Machine → HTTPS/REST API → APIC Controller
If we didn't use localhost ansible_connection=local:

Ansible would try to SSH into the APIC
This would fail because APIC doesn't support direct SSH automation
You'd get connection errors since APIC expects API calls, not SSH connections

This is why the inventory file is simple:
iniCopylocalhost ansible_connection=local
All the actual connection details (APIC IP, username, password) are handled in the vars file and used by the ACI modules to make API calls.
